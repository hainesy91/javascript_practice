//The key difference between a while loop and a do while loop is that the statements in the code block come before the condition. This means that those statements are run once whether or not the condition is met.

var i = 1 //Set counter to 1
var msg = ''; //Message

//Store 5 times table in a variable
do {
  msg += i + ' x 5 = ' + (i * 5) + '<br />';
  i++;
} while (i < 1);
//Note how this is already 1 and still runs

document.getElementById('answer3').innerHTML = msg;

//If you take a look at the condition, it is checking that the value of the variable called i is less than 1, but that variable has already been set to the value of 1. Therefore, in this example, the result is that the 5 times table is written out once, even though the counter is not less than 1.
