//Here is an example of a while loop. It writes out the 5 times table. Each time the loop is run, another calculation is written into the variable called msg.

//This loop will continue to run for as long as the condition in the parenthesis is true. That condition is a counter indicating that, as long as the variable i remains less than 10, the statements in the subsequent code block should run.
